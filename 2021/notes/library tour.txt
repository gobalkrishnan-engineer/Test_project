Core:
 1. dart:async -       Support for asynchronous programming, with classes such as Future and Stream 
 2. dart:collection -  Classes and utilities that supplement the collection support in dart:core 
 3. dart:convert -     Encoders and decoders for converting between different data representations, including JSON and UTF-8
 4. dart:core -        Built-in types, collections, and other core functionality for every Dart program 
 5. dart:developer -   Interact with developer tools such as the debugger and inspector 
 6. dart:math -        Mathematical constants and function, plus a random number generator 
 7. dart:typed_data -  Lists that efficiently handle fixed sized data (for example, unsigned 8 byte integers) and SIMD numeric types
VM:
 1. dart:ffi -      Foreign Function interface for interoperability with the C programming language 
 2. dart:io -       File, socket, HTTP, and other I/O support for non-web applications 
 3. dart:isolate  - Concurrent programming using isolats: independent workers that are similar to threads but don't share memory, communicating only via messages.
 4. dart:mirrors -  Basic reflection in Dart, with support for introspection and dynamic invocation 
Web:
 1. dart:html -        HTML elements and other resources for web-based applications that need to interact with the browser and the DOM (Document Object Model)
 2. dart:indexed_db -  A client-side key-value store with support for indexes
 3. dart:js -          Low-level support for interoperating with Javascript 
 4. dart:js_util -     Utility methods to manipulate (package:js) annotated Javascript interop objects in cases where the name to call is not known at runtime
 5. dart:svg -         Scalable Vector Graphics: Two-dimensional vector graphics with support for events and animations 
 6. dart:web_audio -   High-fidelity audio programming in the browser 
 7. dart:web_gl -      3D programming in the browser 
 8. dart:web_sql -     An API for storing data in the browser that can be queried with SQL
