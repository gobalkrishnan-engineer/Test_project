# Words with the superscript **1** are **contextual keywords**, 
   
   * which have meaning only in specific places.
   * They're valid identifier everywhere.

# Words with the superscript **2** are **built-in identifier**,
  
   * To simplify the task of porting Javascript code to Dart, these keywords 
     are valid identifier in most places, 
   * but they can't be used as class or type names, or as import prefixes.

# Words with the superscript **3** are **limited reserved words**,
  
   * related to asynchrony support.
   * you can't use await or yield as an identifier in any function body marked with 
     async, async*, or sync*
